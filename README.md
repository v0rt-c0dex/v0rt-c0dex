OVERVIEW

For those who read between frequencies.
For those who trace the path of the jaguar across firewalls.
For those who understand Telegram is not just an app — it's a veil.

CONTENTS

Encrypted clues using Mayan numerology, Tzolk’in, and Long Count calendar structures.

Messages encoded with references to real Telegram community events, censorship, and moderation tactics.

Steganographic images.

Symbolic cryptographic signatures.

Python scripts for decoding and encrypting using custom v0rt-c0dex logic.

Reward drops: factual, controversial information unlocked through specific cipher sequences.

THREE LEVELS OF INTEL

Level 1: Public Clues
Visible encrypted fragments. No external tools required. Clues are decipherable using Caesar/Base64 + v0rt scripts.

Level 2: Encrypted Paths
Requires use of date-based permutations (e.g., 13 K’an Tzolk’in logic) and substitution layers. Hints are embedded in glyph structures or metadata.

Level 3: Protocol-Side Revelations
Unlocks confidential insights about Telegram’s internal behavior:

How @SpamBot interacts with community reports.

Hidden thresholds for account warnings and automatic restrictions.

The non-documented link between join rate surges and temporary shadowbans.

Behavioral analysis patterns based on client version ID (tdlib, botapi, etc).

MAIN STEPS

1. Begin with clue1.txt and its paired .md file. Decode Base64 and follow the hint instructions.


2. Each clue builds on the previous, introducing new cipher layers. Keep notes.


3. Use the scripts in /scripts to assist with decoding or encoding patterns.


4. Pay attention to metadata in files — some contain embedded glyphs or encrypted keys.


5. Download and examine dsa_method.pdf (available from clue4) — this document contains structured guidance.


6. Upon reaching final clue, locate and interpret final.json for signature validation.


7. Send your symbolic signature to v0rt47A@null.net for recruitment.

FIRST TRANSMISSION

Explore the repository from the main branch. Clues are stored in chronological order: clue1.txt to clue4.txt. Hidden objects require context-aware decryption and are marked in metadata, file hashes, or name variations.
