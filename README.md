### OVERVIEW

For those who read between frequencies.  
For those who trace the path of the jaguar across firewalls.  
For those who understand Telegram is not just an app—it's a veil.

### THREE LEVELS OF INTEL

**Level 1: Public Clues**  
Visible encrypted fragments with no external tools required. Clues are decipherable using Caesar/Base64 + v0rt scripts.

**Level 2: Encrypted Paths**  
Requires using date-based permutations (e.g., 13 K’an Tzolk’in logic) and substitution layers. Hints are hidden in glyph structures or metadata.

**Level 3: Protocol-Side Revelations**  
Unlocks confidential insights about Telegram’s internal behavior:
- How `@SpamBot` interacts with community reports.
- Hidden thresholds for account warnings and automatic restrictions.
- The non-documented link between join rate surges and temporary shadowbans.
- Behavioral analysis patterns based on client version ID (use of `tdlib`, `botapi`, etc).

All content is unethical, and some consists of classified documentation. I am not responsible for how it is used or how Telegram may act in response.
