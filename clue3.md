# Clue 3: Behavioral Moderation & Device Fingerprinting

**Seal:** 11 Etz’nab’ — Mirror Protocol

This fragment discusses Telegram’s deeper layer of content control:  
moderation based not on user interaction, but on **behavioral patterns and device signals**.

## Description

Recent forensic studies (2022–2023) indicate the use of **fingerprinting algorithms** targeting TDLib forks and unauthorized clones.

Russian-based moderation clusters have reportedly:

- Leveraged memory leaks and non-standard encryption calls as identification vectors.
- Suppressed entire client stacks before user activity, based on behavioral similarity to previously banned instances.
- Used XPrivacyLua forensic logs and municipal ASN IP overlaps to fine-tune blocklists.

### Decryption Instructions

1. **Base64 decode** the string.
2. Use **Vigenère cipher** with key `mirrorlog` on the result.
3. Analyze the output:  
   Final string may contain a **token or hash** linked to deeper resources or coordinates for ASN comparison.

### Reward Upon Decryption

You will unlock:

- Logs of **Telegram’s behavioral-based preemptive bans**, triggered before user complaints.
- TDLib clone identifiers recovered from research devices in **Novosibirsk** and **Kazan**.
- ASN/IP reports showing moderation bots tied to **non-standard public infrastructure nodes**.

**Sources:**

- XPrivacyLua logs (2022–2023)  
- RIPE ASN mappings (Deutsche Telekom, Rostelecom)  
- Telegram v9.4 beta channel analysis
