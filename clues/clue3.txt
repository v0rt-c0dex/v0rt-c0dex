Seal: 11 Etz’nab’ — Mirror Protocol

A threshold exists where moderation tools cease to be external.  
Behavioral fingerprinting replaces user reporting.  
Data flows between device behavior and pattern recognition nodes.

> "Telegram’s internal traffic shaping system monitors TDLib instance memory leaks to detect non-standard message patterns."

> "Russian-based mod teams in 2023 used fingerprint templates from banned devices (via XPrivacyLua logs) to proactively suppress clones — before user interaction."

> "At least 3 regional moderation bots were linked to external IPs overlapping with municipal infrastructure."

Hint:
- Decode the Base64.
- Decrypt the resulting message using Vigenère cipher with the key: `mirrorlog`
- Extract coordinates and compare against ASN mapping via RIPE DB.

**Reward upon decryption:**  
Access to a report on Telegram’s behavioral-based moderation system (2023),  
including logs of preemptive bans triggered **before user complaints**.  
Also includes metadata leaks from cloned TDLib forks used in research projects in Novosibirsk and Kazan.

Verified sources:
- XPrivacyLua forensic exports (2022–2023)  
- ASN IP overlap logs from Deutsche Telekom / Rostelecom  
- Telegram Beta v9.4 traffic anomaly test results
