A European relay used for Telegram moderation was documented in 2023, tied to enforcement under the Digital Services Act (DSA).

The operation involved silent takedowns routed through law enforcement proxies, bypassing public-facing moderation. The requests were justified under clauses of "coordinated manipulation" and "digital public safety".
